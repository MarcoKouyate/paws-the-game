# PAWS THE GAME

## Pitch

> PAWS is a 2D top-down dungeon crawler where your goal is to escape a labyrinth full of traps, robots and puzzles. However, you cannot attack. Your only power is to swap positions with anything in the room, including enemies and objects. Thanks to this simple power, the player can fight enemies by using their weapons against them. Use this power wisely to turn the tables against fate.

* Explore the labyrinth. The level is composed of many rooms with different challenges: enemies, puzzles, platforms. Clear each room in order to progress.
* Use the power of swap to avoid attacks and traps.
* Use the power of swap in order to trap the enemies or solve puzzles.
* Find your friends and release them.
